# Renewable Energy's Economic Impact in the U.S. 
**Introduction & Purpose**

In recent years, the U.S. has seen a surge in the deployment of renewable energy sources, driven both by environmental concerns and economic incentives. While various news outlets (i.e. Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal) and databases (e.g. Census Bureau, Energy Information Administration) provide data on the current state of renewable energy and its economic implications, a deeper analysis is needed to understand the economic impact of different renewable energy sources across U.S. states and sectors. Our project aim is to bridge the gap, converting raw data into the prime data for analysis, examining the relationship between renewable energy production, consumption, and economic indicators such as GDP. 

These analyses can help policymakers, environmental researchers, data scientists, and large organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the United Nations (U.N.) develop targeted strategies for optimizing renewable energy deployment, reducing reliance on traditional energy sources, and mitigating climate change. For example, by identifying trends in the adoption of Alternative Fuel Stations (AFS), agencies like the EPA and U.N. can allocate resources more effectively, focusing more on gathering and distributing funds to create more AFSs that accelerate the transition to renewable energy. Thus, using our project's results for making decisions which improve both the environment and the economy.

**Insights**

Analyzed Sectors: Electric Power, Industrial, Residential, Commercial (1949-2023)
Sector with the highest total renewable energy consumption: Industrial sector at 111415.74 Trillion btu, not the Electric Power sector at 91597.39 Trillion btu. 
We think that the industrial sector has consumed the most energy between 1949 and 2023 because it takes up vast amounts of energy to support its production and manufacturing industries.                               

Each sectorâ€™s most consumed renewable energy source:
- Industrial Sector consumes biomass energy the most at 110,480.94 Trillion btu,
- Electric Power Sector consumes conventional hydroelectric power at 58,757.67 Trillion btu
- Residential Sector consumes wood energy at 36,997.09 Trillion btu
- Commercial Sector consumes biomass energy at 4,732.62 Trillion btu.
It was not surprising to see that the residential sector consumes mostly wood energy because people use wood consistently to power and heat their homes.
Biomass energy appears to be becoming the next most popular renewable energy source in industrial and commercial sectors, moving away from fossil fuels and other harmful energy sources.

While the correlations between year and electric power, industrial, and residential sectors were strong at 0.914, 0.943, and 0.93 respectively, the residential sector had a really weak correlation to year at 0.074. Its regression plots showed likewise with the residential sector having a sinusoidal curve, suggesting no relationship, while all other sectors had an increasing linear relationship. This suggests that all other sectors are focusing on increasing their total renewable energy consumption over the years and leaving climate-damaging energy sources behind (oil, fossil fuels etc.) while residential sectors have years where they increase and decrease their renewable energy consumption levels (switching between renewable and non-renewable energy consumption).

**Contributions** 
- Harshini Dinesh (4381hdinesh@gmail.com) 
  - Cleaned up data on energy consumption by sector and data on accessibility of alternative fuel stations (AFS)
  - Analyzed data to find out if initial hypotheses were true
     - Hypothesis: Given the growth of the EV industry, the electric power sector has consumed more renewable energy than the industrial, commercial, and 
       residential sectors. --> False; the industrial sector has consumed more energy than all other sectors.
     - Hypothesis: Given the growth of the EV industry, there are more alternative fuel stations available to the public for electric cars than for stations 
       providing other fuels. --> True
  - Created visualizations (bar charts, lineplots) for data to show how different sectors consume different energy types,
    and to show how many AFS are accessible privately versus publicly. 
  - Conducted correlation and regression analysis (regression plots to understand how different sectors consumed energy over time (at an    
    increasing/decreasing/inconsistent rate) 
  - Evaluated how to enhance the current code to improve predictions for future energy consumption by sector and future AFS accessibility.
- Hang Hang(hang.h@husky.neu.edu)
  - Cleaned up data on median household income, geographical, and cost of charging electric vehicles (EV)
  - Analyzed how state locations correlate with energy production to test intial hypotheses
  - Analyzed the impact of economic incentives (i.e., tax, utility, infrastructure) on EV and clean energy adoption to validate hypothesis 4
  - Used heat maps for energy production across states and multiple linear regression to assess the combined effects of economic factors on EV adoption.
- Ryan Jiang (jiang.ry@husky.neu.edu)
  - Cleaned up data on state renewable energy consumption, production, price, and GDP from 1970-2020
  - Calculated basic statistics and correlation, creating line charts, scatter plots, and bar plots to see which states/regions had the greatest changes in 
    energy prices, consumption, and production over time. This also proved hypothesis 2 true: there is a positive correlation between a state's GDP and its 
    energy consumption.
  - Analyzed the change in renewable energy consumption and production for each state from 1970 onwards, identifying the states with the most significant changes.
  - Determined the top states with the highest ratios of energy consumption and production relative to real GDP.
- Hersh Joshi (jhersh003@gmail.com)
  - Analyzed the impact of population, climate, geographical location on energy consumption.
  - Compared EV charging costs with traditional fuel costs
